## Background
The Dataset contains stock price of the stock "Netflix" for the five years period i.e., from 5th Feb 2018 to 5th Feb 2022. This Data includes columns such as Date, Open, Close, High, Low, Volume, and Adjusted Close.

The art of forecasting stock prices has been a difficult task for many of the researchers and analysts. In fact, investors are highly interested in the research area of stock price prediction. For a good and successful investment, many investors are keen on knowing the future situation of the stock market. Good and effective prediction systems for the stock market help traders, investors, and analyst by providing supportive information like the future direction of the stock market.

**Research Questions**
1. Can we develop accurate predictive models for stock price using machine learning techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, etc?
2. Which evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Sharpe Ratio) should be used to assess the performance of the stock price prediction models?
3. Which machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, time series models) are most suitable for stock price prediction, and how do their performance compare?
4. What are the optimal hyperparameters for the selected machine learning models to achieve the best predictive performance?
5. What insights can be gained from exploratory data analysis, such as identifying patterns, correlations, or anomalies in the historical stock price data?
6. What features derived from the raw data (e.g., moving averages, technical indicators, volatility measures) are most effective in improving prediction accuracy?
7. What are the most common data quality issues (e.g., missing values, outliers) in stock price datasets, and how can they be effectively addressed in the preprocessing stage?
8. Are there ethical considerations in using stock price prediction models, such as potential market manipulation or unintended biases in trading decisions?
9.  Can the models be deployed for real-time stock price prediction, and what are the challenges associated with maintaining accuracy in a dynamic market environment?
